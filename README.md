Post-a-Note is a tiny note taking application that resides in your system tray

## Requirements
Yad

# Quickstart

After starting Post-a-Note, left click on it's system tray icon to bring up the note pop-up window.  Hit Esc to save changes.  Close the window to NOT save your last changes.  Right-click to bring up a menu.

To be more productive, one can make a keyboard shortcut (such as Win-N) to have Post-a-Note's popup window appear..

# Limitations

Left-Clicking should also save you last changes, but there is an issue with Yad that has to be addressed.
